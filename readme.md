# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a comprehensive set of scripts and notebooks focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. EDA helps in understanding datasets, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and making informed decisions for data preprocessing and modeling.

### EDA Scripts

The repository covers key EDA processes through the following Python scripts:

* **Discretization.py:** Converts continuous variables into categorical variables using various binning techniques.
* **Dummy Variables.py:** Creates dummy/indicator variables for categorical features to prepare data for modeling.
* **Duplication & Typecasting:** Handles duplicate values and typecasts columns to appropriate data types.
* **Missing Value Imputation.py:** Identifies and imputes missing values using different strategies (mean, median, mode, etc.).
* **Outlier Treatment.py:** Detects and treats outliers using statistical methods like IQR or z-score.
* **Standardization & Normalization.py:** Standardizes and normalizes numeric columns to bring them to a common scale.
* **String Manipulation.py:** Cleans and preprocesses string columns by trimming, lowercasing, and extracting relevant features.
* **Transformation.py:** Applies transformations to columns such as logarithmic, square root, and power transformations.
* **zerovariance.py:** Identifies and removes features with zero variance.
